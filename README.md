# Readable:An anonymous content and comment application

This a web application where users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments.
Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.
This is the final assessment project (#p2) for Udacity's React Fundamentals course developed by me.
For the front-end template used React,Redux, HTML and CSS. Used api-server for backed server built in Node which is provided by the Udacity.

## TL;DR
To run this application right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

To start the server:

* go to the api-server directory `cd api-server`
* install all api-server dependencies with `npm install`
* start the api-server with `node server`
